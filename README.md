Landslide Susceptibility Modeling with Spatial Data-Driven Technology
This repository contains the data, code, and resources related to the study "Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation by Spatial Data-Driven Technology Under Different Resolutions of Slope Units." The research explores the impact of slope unit resolution on landslide susceptibility modeling, utilizing a dataset of 224 historical landslides. The study employs advanced machine learning algorithms, such as the Random Forest - Alternating Decision Tree (RF-ADT) model, to evaluate landslide susceptibility in Shenmu City, China. The analysis was conducted using GRASS GIS and the r.slopeunits method, with a focus on optimizing the internal uniformity and external heterogeneity of slope units. The results provide valuable insights for urban planning and disaster mitigation. For any questions or access to the datasets, please contact the corresponding author at ptsag@metal.ntua.gr.
